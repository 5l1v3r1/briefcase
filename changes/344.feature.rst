Modified the Linux AppImage backend to use Docker.
This ensures that the AppImage is always built in an environment that is
compatible with the support package. It also enables Linux AppImages to be
built on macOS and Windows. "Native" builds (i.e., builds that *don't* use
Docker) can be invoked using the ``--no-docker`` argument.
